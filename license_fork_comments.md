# GPL License Fork Comments

As the author of this fork, I want to express that I am essentially releasing this under GPL under duress. I do not believe in any form of \"Intellectual Property.\"

I understand that the GPL is a copyleft license, but I want to make it abundantly clear that under no circumstances will I ever attempt to enforce any licensing \"violations\" associated with my modifications to the original [godaddy/wp-primer-theme](https://github.com/godaddy/wp-primer-theme) repository. You can do whatever you want with my contributions to this repository under the terms of the UNLICENSE or the MIT or whatever permissive non-copyleft license you feel comfortable with.
